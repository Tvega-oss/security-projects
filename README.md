# Phase One: Fuzzing Techniques with AFL, Jazzer, and Peach

## Introduction

Fuzzing is a software testing technique that involves injecting invalid, malformed, or unexpected inputs into a program to identify vulnerabilities, bugs, or security flaws. In this phase, we focused on implementing fuzzing techniques using AFL, with plans to explore Jazzer and Peach in subsequent phases.

## Objectives

1. **Objective 1**: Implement fuzzing using AFL.
2. **Objective 2**: Explore fuzzing techniques using Jazzer.
3. **Objective 3**: Investigate fuzzing methodologies with Peach.

## Environment Setup

### AFL Installation
1. Install AFL:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install afl
