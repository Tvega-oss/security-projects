# Phase One: Fuzzing Techniques with Jazzer, AFL, and Peach

## 1. Introduction

Fuzzing is a software testing technique that injects malformed, unexpected, or invalid inputs into a program to uncover vulnerabilities, bugs, or security flaws. In this phase, we focus on the following fuzzing tools:

- **Jazzer**: A mutation-based fuzzer for Java applications.
- **AFL (American Fuzzy Lop)**: A coverage-guided fuzzer for C/C++ applications.
- **Peach Fuzzer**: A generation-based fuzzer for structured data like protocols and file formats.

This document outlines the setup, experimentation, and results from the first phase of fuzzing using these tools.
